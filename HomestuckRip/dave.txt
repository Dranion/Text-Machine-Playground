TG: where are you sitting
TG: also he was too fast
TG: but i guess i forgot in the heat of battle
TG: i was going to use it to fight my bro with
TG: it was a lot of mostly useless garbage
TG: i mean not that i care
TG: did you put it somewhere
TG: the stuff scattered all over the roof
TG: also what happened to all my shit
TG: or what
TG: or hatch it
TG: am i supposed to break that thing
TG: sorry
TG: i see no stairs
TG: and yet
TG: you say there will be stairs
TG: well where are they
TG: i was worried we were on the verge of getting some shit done
TG: its awesome where you put that
TG: awesome
TG: oh man
TG: and put it in the microwave
TG: maybe i should try to get it back
TG: its hot as the sizzle side of the steak
TG: do you think thatll take more than four hours
TG: please advise
TG: the egg is now in a nest made of shitty swords and soft puppet ass
TG: ok so
TG: hey look we're learning stuff
TG: so with each new connection in our player chain i guess new weird deployables are introduced
TG: oh also this cd which is 100 but i didnt drop cause it seemed like a stiff allocation of resources for now
TG: and the expensive as hell jumper thing and the cheap shunts which i assume do dick all without the jumpers to put em on
TG: well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples
TG: ok now i know youre making this shit up
TG: so i guess you can buy everything now
TG: yeah
TG: she says 20
TG: hang on ill ask
TG: what the hell
TG: man i only got 200 to splash around with in roses rainbow world
TG: what
TG: the thing costs 1000 for me
TG: wait what
TG: you mean the jumper block thing
TG: but ok
TG: wow that was a weird answer
TG: i dont really need them anymore
TG: what should i do with these beta copies
TG: ok
TG: so really who cares
TG: but then i have to go downstairs anyway to make totems and get cruxite and stuff
TG: because of course you couldnt have just put it next to the alchemiter in the first place
TG: since i wont have to go downstairs and bang the hallway door into the thing and squeeze through every time i want to punch a card
TG: which is sort of cool i guess
TG: so i guess this is just a built in designix
TG: yeah me too
TG: no but hes still got a ton so screw him
TG: but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind
TG: you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns
TG: wow fuck ok
TG: this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck
TG: but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow
TG: what
TG: can you find out
TG: or a brain stem
TG: does it even have a skull
TG: maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull
TG: release a shitload of grist
TG: you kill it
TG: what do you mean
TG: unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave
TG: i dont know beach the thing first i guess
TG: maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall
TG: so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule
TG: im out of grist
TG: nevermind the point is
TG: do you host east european industrial raves
TG: by the way why do you live in this weird compound
TG: im building up your house
TG: good luck bro
TG: i guess im saying be a less shitty troll
TG: yeah i guess i am
TG: it could be a horrible thing though
TG: i dont know you sort of remind me of her anyway so maybe thats a good thing
TG: like her
TG: an antagonism ninja
TG: be like
TG: thats kind of the obtuse alien way of getting it but yeah
TG: i mean unless youre really smooth and inherently likeable like me which youre not
TG: reverse psychology mind games all sorts of machiavellian bullshit
TG: if you want to keep her attention you got to pull out all the stops
TG: alright look
TG: oh
TG: hahaha yes youre on a roll
TG: maybe even too deadpan but its a start keep at it
TG: that was pretty good
TG: oh ok
TG: ok if you want rose to dig you you got to leave that crap in the shitty scifi novels where it belongs
TG: oh my flipping christ
TG: see not everybody always means literally what they say the way john and jade always do
TG: for everything she says take her to mean just the opposite
TG: ok well its easy
TG: you want me to help you win her over
TG: just admit it
TG: all hiding behind your alien shit
TG: what a transparent dodge
TG: hahahaha so terrible
TG: dont deny it bro its obvious
TG: you have a thing for her dont you
TG: whats this about
TG: man wait
TG: so you just watch it like crack and turn black
TG: and now its too much trouble to fish out with the tongs
TG: like a stray hotdog that rolled down there
TG: you have no idea dude she is so in my grill
TG: what the hell
TG: wrong what do you want
TG: i command her alright i am like the pimpmaster hustledaddy of all snippy bookshrews
TG: oh yeah sure
TG: who
TG: dont care
TG: but alright later
TG: ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
TG: i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
TG: and
TG: it seems to be suggesting something here
TG: ok fine but
TG: anyway what do you think
TG: like a few hours into her magic stupid quest
TG: cause obviously its fuckin prime time for swiping some shuteye about now
TG: like she got smacked in the face with a pillow case full of the snooze wizards beard dander
TG: all tuckered out
TG: yeah i saw her there
TG: shes asleep for some reason
TG: not sure what to do
TG: it seems to want me to prototype it again
TG: with a sword in it
TG: turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
TG: my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
TG: i need some advice
TG: ok
TG: what are you doing
TG: stfu
TG: yeah
TG: then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
TG: just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
TG: imagine the worst day of my life
TG: i dont want to talk about it
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
TG: the medium
TG: ok im in
TG: im gonna go now
TG: yeah thatd be cool i guess
TG: anything else is gravy
TG: the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog myself raw with my own brain stem
TG: and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner without all that fuss you went through
TG: so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the way to make it happen
TG: our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i think
TG: try going to sleep
TG: and above all try not to do anything retarded
TG: just roll with it and see what happens
TG: you cant overthink it
TG: the thing with time travel is
TG: maybe
TG: i mean your whole timeline will
TG: i dont know
TG: nah itll be fine dont worry
TG: with our higher levels and all our sick gear
TG: even we couldnt kill one of those things yet
TG: i dont know what he was thinking
TG: i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a gullible stooge
TG: theres not much to remember
TG: only thing left to do is change all that
TG: and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or not shes as good as dead from our perspective 
TG: i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us
TG: after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed to him by the denizen
TG: or the trolls for that matter
TG: yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never heard from her again
TG: cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch
TG: we lost
TG: what else is there to know
TG: i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time hopping
TG: or something
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months
TG: im going back
TG: it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless mindnumbing jackass
TG: thats it i cant take it anymore
TG: but alright later
TG: ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
TG: i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
TG: and
TG: it seems to be suggesting something here
TG: ok fine but
TG: anyway what do you think
TG: like a few hours into her magic stupid quest
TG: cause obviously its fuckin prime time for swiping some shuteye about now
TG: like she got smacked in the face with a pillow case full of the snooze wizards beard dander

TG: imagine the worst day of my life
TG: i dont want to talk about it
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
TG: the medium
TG: ok im in
TG: somethings up
TG: dont go yet
TG: WAIT
TG: or youre gonna die
TG: he says dont go
TG: wearing a rad suit
TG: from the future
TG: i just appeared
TG: its me
TG: ok its me from the future
TG: just stay on the goddamn ground for fucks sake
TG: and helping you all stay alive and do this thing the right way this time
TG: im turning this timeline over to past dave
TG: ok well just dont ok
TG: oh god did you just blast off
TG: dont make me track you down through time and stop you in person
TG: this sort of cornball horseshit is your cup of tea not mine
TG: yeah exactly why would i bother
TG: this is future dave by the way
TG: if our friendship means anything youll listen to me and past dave
TG: john stop being a tool and unbuckle yourself from that piece of shit
TG: this guy is me if i get him to talk to you youre just talking to me again jesus it proves nothing
TG: do you hear what youre saying oh my god
TG: ok that was probably the dumbest thing you ever said just now
TG: he says i dunno gullible enough to trust a leetspeaking troll who wants you dead and strap on a rocket pack cause she said to
TG: oh man and if weve just concluded anything its that talking to those dbags should be priority number one so yeah go right ahead
TG: him turning into a floating sword bird
TG: and like
TG: about future me
TG: so you believe me then
TG: oh ok
TG: on a back to the future poster
TG: fist bump my future self til i got bloody knuckles and write you an even sappier bday note in my own blood
TG: god dammit what do i have to do to make you believe me
TG: did you blast off like a spazzy douche yet or what
TG: im coming down to the computer

TG: you dont have to read them im not telling you to
TG: see those two notebooks on the floor behind you
TG: but here just do this one thing
TG: fine dont
TG: shit doesnt get more clear than that
TG: yeah
TG: it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep
TG: shes out like a light anyway
TG: dude no come on
TG: but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up
TG: ok i dont know what youre doing here
TG: i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours
TG: maybe you should look at it
TG: isnt that your birthday package there
TG: what is even with you
TG: seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there
TG: so rose doesnt think you were snooping
TG: maybe put them back on the floor
TG: you can ditch the books now if you want
TG: alright cool
TG: just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all
TG: dude you dont have to tell me the code
TG: so you can see the code
TG: flip it over
TG: take the card the books are on
TG: like for important game reasons and stuff
TG: this is important
TG: now i need you to do something else
TG: get some sky monsters to boss me around sounds cool
TG: anyway yeah i guess ill do that
TG: dunno
TG: ..........................
TG: ........
TG: ....
TG: no what a ridiculous question
TG: uh yeah

TG: you mean when we were dancing and stuff in our dreams
TG: when did they say that
TG: i thought that was a joke
TG: oh yeah
TG: youre probably burning your nutjob meow book to spite her too arent you
TG: you and she could probably have been chatting up how awesome wizards were this whole time but no
TG: she probably digs wizards for real just like you and youre blowing shit out of proportion like pretty much always
TG: that you think that
TG: oh man thats so messed up
TG: whats the deal with that
TG: i thought you hated wizards
TG: do you want me to chew him out about it i will because that was so outrageous i dont know where he got off being like that
TG: and i was like i dont even want to know this is such a crazy violation of privacy
TG: then he was like haha dude check it out this book is full of wizard slash
TG: so not cool
TG: he was all snoopin around your room while you were asleep and i was like no man dont
TG: john told me
TG: i cant keep track of what you like anymore
TG: or something to do with tentacle monsters
TG: is that some dumb wizard thing you just made up
TG: then why are you burning that
TG: oh ok

TG: ok im out of the loop again
TG: are you talking to future me
TG: yeah thats fine
TG: god so beautiful to look at with my perfect eyesight

TG: like a couple of eagle eyed bros peepin shit up into the wee hours
TG: havin a see party
TG: just him and me
TG: cause we can both see
TG: and yet as much as that guys the tooliest dude i could ever hope to meet he and i would still get along famously
TG: my broken body would flop and tumble around like a rag doll
TG: i could try but it would wind up like a motorcycle stunt gone horribly wrong
TG: i could give myself a hernia trying to be as big a douche as that guy
TG: this miraculous gift of vision
TG: just one of those little joys in life you take for granted you know
TG: every day i open my eyes i find poetry in even the simplest things
TG: shit is beautiful like a little vermilion picnic on my hands
TG: like a fuckin symphony on my retinas
TG: but i sure as hell know what it looks like
TG: i dont know what it smells like or tastes like
TG: this is moronic

TG: so im staying on track here
TG: and if i started ranting too much about the future id start sounding like one of these smug alternian shitheads and im not about to drop that retarded science on my good bro
TG: but im not about to get into specifics cause this is complicated enough as it is
TG: and together were up to our bulges and miscellaneous bullshit alien physiology in hot sloppy shenanigans while hatching plans under our feathery asses like a bunch of cage free farm fresh motherfuckers
TG: well youre you
TG: rose is crazy jades crazier and youre
TG: noirs outta control
TG: oh you know
TG: its like they heard somebody over here was handing out asses and theyve known nothing but years of bitter ass famine
TG: ive been laying waste to chumps nonstop
TG: i dont know man they seem to flock to me
TG: i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us
TG: the 24 hour span of the reckoning is like some kind of critical spike in us dealing with troll bullshit
TG: man dont even get me started with that
TG: yeah
TG: ive got some help though
TG: thats how stable time loops work shit takes a lot of planning and precise choreography
TG: i mean they will all become me and ill become them one way or another
TG: but they are all me
TG: there are a bunch of daves running around the timeline
TG: yeah
TG: no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody
TG: this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops
TG: ive been very careful
TG: or not
TG: yeah it can work that way
TG: leave it to the pros ok
TG: its kiddie bullshit time is serious fucking business
TG: like what angle to blow it at to fly a damn kite or how gentle its gotta be to make a picnic go swimmingly
TG: youre on easy street what is there even to think about with wind

CTG: oh god stop talking about my lips thats the second time
CTG: see how i look right now thats a poker face might want to take some notes
CTG: haha wow bingo
CTG: or maybe it was a guy who rejected you
CTG: is that how it went down
CTG: holding a bucket full of flowers or slime or whatever and jade was like no thanks bro
CTG: how did it go did you stand in a quadrant like you were playing four square
CTG: did one of the human ladies reject you
CTG: you just sound kinda bitter
CTG: i dunno man doesnt sound like you really got our interests in mind here
CTG: doesnt concern you dude
CTG: like the new maconnohey jam where he smirks and like all but deliberately draws the audiences ire like a goddamn magnetron
CTG: would you want to ask her to go see one of your dumbass movies
CTG: and she was on earth visiting your town or something
CTG: if earth wasnt destroyed and she werent in some other universe on a planet full of unspeakable frothing dipshits
CTG: like
CTG: anything more than that
CTG: but i mean
CTG: yeah ok
CTG: do you like her
CTG: i dunno
CTG: smooth
CTG: like you dont want to acknowledge that your troll ladies find a couple of human dudes irresistible
CTG: sounds like a loudmouth inferiority thing going on here to me
CTG: k then bye
CTG: second obviously theres gonna be 4 quadrants come on
CTG: first of all weve got to be on record here as not giving a shit about that
CTG: john god dammit stop embarrassing us
CTG: sounds like its time to get a clue she is over you dude
CTG: right
CTG: theres not any doubt left about that at all
CTG: but now look how far weve come
CTG: back when i suspected these trolls were full of shit
CTG: made it pretty obvious when he started ranting at me months ago
CTG: or he thinks she is or something
CTG: pretty sure she is
CTG: but what else is new just another lady from outer space mackin on me whatever chance she gets
CTG: the guys jealous obviously he thinks his girlfriend has a thing for me and you know what hes probably right

TG: wow ok what does that have to do with me
TG: what are you talking about

TG: is this some weird game involving flirtation and assassinations or whatever
TG: so is that whats going on
TG: yeah i thought so
TG: hows it smell btw
TG: what im sayin is you got a front row seat to the brown side of my burger
TG: privy to what i flame broil from below
TG: doing hard time on a bed of charcoal and lighterfluid
TG: you are practically incarcerated in that fucker
TG: my grill is your goddamn prison
TG: im not saying i know for sure but it seems to me like
TG: to piss him off
TG: and really if we got no other reason keep rolling with it at least theres that one
TG: well yeah thats what i thought too
TG: and that we should quit it because he doesnt want you in my grill or me in yours or whatever
TG: karkat was saying how it was all a game and youre just flirtin and stuff
TG: i mean even if that made sense which it kind of doesnt
TG: alright but

TG: why
?TG:
?TG:
?TG: thats just perfect hahahaha
?TG: and then literally the very next memo you are slobbering all over jade
?TG: dude i cant believe you were just getting on our case about hitting on the troll girls
?TG: ahahahahah oh god
??? turntechGodhead [?TG]
TG: naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
TG: MY GLASSES ARE TALKING TO ME MY GLASSES ARE TALKING TO ME
TG: nakka nakka nak
TG: nak nak nak nak nak nak
TG: nak nak nak
TG: no dont bother john
TG: i completely understand everything about that practically entirely
TG: blew up
TG: something warmer why dont you alchemize some shit
TG: well at least make some damn clothes
TG: i thought you were going inside
TG: ok
TG: my coolness is named after a dead president plus his middle initial to make it sound extra legit
TG: like federally too cool
TG: maybe you missed those credentials i flashed which clearly stated me being too cool for that
TG: im not gonna play in the snow
TG: oh my fucking god
TG: time/shades lets go
TG: time
TG: time then shades
TG: time
TG: time
TG: i need to go look for my teeth on the canvas as soon as shit stops spinning and there stops being like ten of you
TG: whoa jade with the fucking haymaker
TG: when i look around all i see is the miles of unharnessed snowmen im just too damn cool to build
TG: like old man winter spread around his nasty mayonnaise and turned the landscape into his personal asshole sandwich
TG: snows a big chilly carpet of nobody gives a shit
TG: more snow
TG: like
TG: snow and
TG: yeah it is lava and skeletal skyscrapers all melting and shit how is that not way cooler than
TG: lavas better
TG: nah
TG: no
TG: well ive never seen it either now that i think about it
TG: and also inside an active volcano
TG: pretty believable since you lived on guam or wherever the fuck
TG: yup
TG: or you will
TG: you GET things about space i dont
TG: pretty different things
TG: my thing is time yours is space
TG: well yeah
TG: while everyone else is sort of in slow motion stuck in the thick of the alpha
TG: they are my hours but not everyone elses theyre kind of like private hours all to myself
TG: i mean
TG: i guess im sorta used to it by now i dont think of hours going by the same way anymore
TG: yeah
TG: picked up where we left off
TG: went back in time
TG: i ran around for an hour got my ass some place warm
TG: a second for you
TG: an hour for me
TG: an hour later
TG: ok im back
TG: so im gonna go some place warm be back in a while later
TG: hey its pretty fucking cold
TG: its ok
TG: yeah
TG: yeah jade thats what future me means
TG: one of the future mes that is
TG: this is future me
TG: no i was
TG: just wanted to see if you were cool
TG: but at the moment im standing in the middle of this snowy goddamn field freezing my shit off
TG: i remember seeing you twice before in different locations
TG: three places
TG: youll get better dont worry
TG: no you can kill them
TG: then you disappeared
TG: shooting at an imp
TG: you appeared for a second
TG: yeah
TG: i just saw you
TG: its not the point i just wanted to say
TG: ok i dont know what youre talking about it was probably just some horrorterror chirping at you during one of your nap bubble mindfucks
TG: welcome to the medium finally i guess
TG: hey
TG: check out how much ive got
TG: no it costs practically nothing
TG: deploy the intellibeam laserstation
TG: now
TG: yeah
TG: im back at my place now
TG: as in a few seconds
TG: yeah
TG: in a few hours ill go back there and we can continue this
TG: in my apartment
TG: i need you to deploy something first
TG: well youre my server player remember
TG: so i guess here we are doing it
TG: yeah honestly i figured wed have to do something like this
TG: we just have to think outside the box here
TG: but youre not completely screwed
TG: probably some shit like thats what happened
TG: so he cant do anything for you anyways
TG: in any case egbert lost his computer and game disc
TG: so maybe youre startin out with more sense than me
TG: but i was all like IM A LITTLE BLACK RAIN CLOUD BITCH WATCH ME CLIMB
TG: you told me how it worked all christopher robinning my ignorant ass about that egg
TG: and you even knew what to do
TG: so even though im awesome now at one point i was plausibly likened to an autistic stuffed animal
TG: i was like goddamn pooh bear in a tree reaching up his fat fuckin pooh paw for some mother fuckin honey
TG: what the hell was i doing
TG: remember how i was scrambling up that tower to get that egg like an idiot
TG: we all start out somewhere
TG: almost
TG: as the chump of shoosh
TG: getting all his ridiculous magic cyclone powers on and realizing his huge blowy destiny
TG: wind mission or whatever
TG: hes on like his fuckin
TG: thats why this is so dumb
TG: yeah well
TG: and artificial intelligence to figure it out
TG: needs sophisticated scanning technology
TG: the human eye cant decipher them
TG: some are too garbled and complicated
TG: yeah
TG: it reads captcha codes
TG: but itll come in handy here
TG: its mostly pretty stupid and useless
TG: im duplicating my server disc
TG: whats it look like
TG: thats also the good news
TG: the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us
TG: which is good news and bad news
TG: basically robots are in control now
TG: now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit
TG: and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam
TG: but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box
TG: that would be fucking mayhem
TG: a potted plant
TG: cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like
TG: and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason
TG: well yeah thats what captchas are for
TG: so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure
TG: like an anti piracy measure
TG: i guess some captchas are so incomprehensible cause the game thinks it would be too cheap to let you duplicate them
TG: time to roll with it
TG: been a change of plans
TG: but now hes not
TG: he got you in didnt he
TG: well he was
TG: this games already so far off the rails what else is there to do but improvise
TG: we have to get creative here
TG: dont see why not
TG: ill just install it
TG: hes got shit to do
TG: nah i told you were not bothering john
TG: yeah i know
TG: by now im pretty used to having my intuition woven into the fabric of the alpha timeline
TG: and trusting they were the ones you were always supposed to make
TG: managing the loops is a balance of careful planning and just rolling with your in the moment decisions
TG: like it is now
TG: i just figured when the time came to sort it out the right thing to do would be obvious
TG: i never really studied how it went down all that closely
TG: yeah more or less
TG: now i need you to go downstairs
TG: dont worry about it just some more future stuff
TG: in the meantime ill kind of loiter around this timeframe to help you out for a while
TG: yeah see its not hard to get the hang of
TG: and become your server player
TG: eventually become me
TG: make a ton of money and stuff
TG: then he can start hopping around time like i did
TG: until she sorta checks out soon and becomes totally useless
TG: he can keep managing her for a while
TG: the one in the black suit
TG: which is to say present me will
TG: and past me will stay as roses server
TG: i will be your server
TG: well technically
TG: while the original will stay bound to roses connection
TG: thisll be the disc i use for your connection
TG: whatever
TG: few days i guess
TG: yeah but it kind of literally is for me
TG: which seems like a hella long time ago
TG: which are really the exact same codes you first gave me when we upgraded my alchemiter
TG: ill give you some codes and you can punch cards and slip em into jumper blocks
TG: im just going to cut right to the chase and upgrade your alchemiter so you can avoid a lot of bullshit
TG: what just happened
TG: hey
TG: :(
TG: :V
TG: naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
TG: THE GLASSES ARE TALKING AGAIN
TG: nak nak nak
TG: a plea for help
TG: like
TG: im pretty sure it was
TG: in totality
TG: but
TG: i couldnt really focus on anything specific
TG: their voices became clearer
TG: when i saw them
TG: and
TG: and scoping out its all you can eat seafood buffet
TG: peering through the dark portal of an eldritch red lobster
TG: it was like
TG: yeah
TG: horrible things
TG: i did
TG: yeah
TG: oh
TG: but yeah i understand defending your collection i guess if you were in my dream room and talking shit about my awesome dream portraits of dream stiller and dream snoop or whatever wed have to have a fucking talk
TG: nah
TG: all your books are bizarre and terrible
TG: dream book collection
TG: or
TG: whats with your book collection
TG: being all creepy and dream duplicitous and shit
TG: i was in your dream room for a while spying on you
TG: and kind of boring
TG: weird
TG: thats all you needed to say everythings cool and under control then
TG: oh ok time travels involved
TG: i am
TG: i guess i should catch up with her
TG: is she ok what was going on there
TG: so shes here then
TG: oh yeah
TG: oh ok cool
TG: theyre hideous and obnoxious
TG: who cares if theyre getting killed
TG: whats that mean
TG: tell them to keep their lecherous flagella to themselves
TG: stroke a mummys paw or some horseshit and open a dark channel
TG: use your powers and like
TG: im not about to get molested by calamari with fucking teeth
TG: oh god why would i want that 
TG: went and perved up some sleeping girls room to take my mind of it
TG: so i slapped my shades back on
TG: no it was disturbing
TG: plot a course to what
TG: why
TG: a treasure map
TG: like
TG: what am i supposed to do
TG: ok
TG: fuck mind = blown
TG: no really are you serious i didnt even notice
TG: oh shit youre kidding
TG: then what
TG: ok you fly to it
TG: so i take my map and fly to this thing
TG: fair enough
TG: seeing as youre the seer whatever that means
TG: i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either
TG: full of wormholes or something
TG: what is it like
TG: space isnt my thing remember
TG: not really sure why navigating the space would be a problem though
TG: being the knight of time here
TG: with like loops and causality paradoxes and shit like that
TG: i can kind of get that time is messed up there
TG: blast off to adventure
TG: point a spaceship that way
TG: tell us what direction its in
TG: cant they just
TG: why do we need a map
TG: and then i guess we go there for some reason
TG: with the help of a million rambunctious gross tentacle mutants
TG: so ok i make a map to this thing
TG: i mean hopy shit thats huge
TG: see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be
TG: ok thats pretty fucking big
TG: planet fucking jupiter
TG: or is it only as big as like
TG: or bigger
TG: is it like the size of our sun
TG: i need a sense of scale here
TG: how big
TG: yeah
TG: and by extension i guess jack
TG: i mean aside from giving jades dog his devil powers
TG: whats the deal with this thing
TG: i mean the <img border="0" src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/greensun.gif"/> my bad
TG: wait sorry
TG: oh right the green sun ok
TG: just tell me
TG: ok i wont say anything
TG: ok cool what is it
TG: well ok you can keep doing it then
TG: jesus can we stop with the fancy colored text bullshit
TG: i mean the tumor
TG: so whats 
TG: yeah
TG: so hes got to get the cancer out of skaia right
TG: is there anything you do thats not sending dudes on quests
TG: you mean with the quest youre sending him on
TG: ok i get it now
TG: what
TG: wait
TG: whys he want to die
TG: even if he is omniscient which he probably isnt what if hes just lying
TG: oh so he knows everything
TG: sounds like a really credible dude sign me up for trusting everything he says
TG: what you mean a troll
TG: what
TG: are these just a bunch of orders youre following
TG: did you get it all from the gods
TG: seriously whered you get all this info
TG: first time for everything i guess
TG: what the hell is a bomb doing in there
TG: later
TG: when i feel like getting around to it i mean
TG: ill be over here paving the way for your elaborate dream suicide
TG: well im suddenly not interested so go talk to your fairy god troll
TG: oh ok
TG: yeah see what i mean
TG: is it the absurd juggalo one that would be hilarious
TG: which ones yours
TG: too many of them who can even keep track of this shit
TG: fuckin trolls
TG: god
TG: who did that
TG: when did that happen
TG: what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again
TG: its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning
TG: no shes cool
TG: oh yeah terezi
TG: no
TG: what
TG: then travel back to about now and go to sleep
TG: dog it as long as possible
TG: so
TG: alright
TG: this is going to be fucking stupid isnt it
TG: a solid black piece of paper
TG: which i guess is just like
TG: make this map
TG: so when do i do my thing
TG: yeah i know
TG: for future reference
TG: for someone whos saying lets cool it on the drama the whole i wont be coming back thing is a pretty theatrical bombshell
TG: way to leave me hanging there
TG: those fuckers are all kinds of mad expendable
TG: haha yeah thats fine i guess
TG: oh
TG: hey look suddenly everything we just talked about was useless because its time to make a plan that doesnt fucking suck
TG: no bullshit thats not happening
TG: a suicide mission are you serious
TG: whoa fuck
TG: what exactly did you do
TG: ok so how did this happen where did we fuck up
TG: which means hes doomed
TG: must be from an offshoot timeline
TG: so this isnt part of our timeline choreography at all
TG: and hes not from the past because id remember doing this
TG: this guy isnt from the future who came back to finish a loop
TG: so if im understanding this
TG: i wonder if this can finally be the conversation that doesnt deteriorate into a lot of bitching and moaning about her
TG: ok got it
TG: who
TG: says the sword holding guy whos about to add one to the pile
TG: and dead daves are the enemy remember
TG: if we make mistakes then dead daves start piling up
TG: why wouldnt i be concerned about that
TG: then what
TG: do i have the stable loop right
TG: and then go back in time and sleep in this bed and get killed by me right now
TG: which i thought we both agreed id retired from the wardrobe forever
TG: does this mean later im going to have to put this ugly goddamn suit back on
TG: so is he from the future
TG: or reaching the god tier im pretty sure thats something id remember
TG: i dont remember sleeping on this bed
TG: who is this guy
TG: something about this doesnt add up
TG: ok i know but
TG: before i decide to start choppin off the heads of outrageously good looking snoozing dudes
TG: i just want to know whats really going on here
TG: being a things not something it ever stopped doing
TG: yes how would it ever stop being a thing
TG: like doing the free will thing
TG: look i dont mind making the decision if thats whats going on here
TG: why dont you just tell me
TG: its lame for you to pretend theres any element of suspense here
TG: you know if im going to or not
TG: but
TG: what do you mean what
TG: ok
TG: you just flipped a coin
TG: ok but you didnt actually give me a choice
TG: what was that like more than a day for me chronologically
TG: that seems like a long time ago already
TG: yeah i remember
TG: why dont you finish your story
TG: its ok flippin coins for reasons is still pretty badass i guess
TG: twoface is a human batman villain whos half ugly and flips coins all the time to make evil decisions
TG: oh yeah
TG: i probably would have gone back in time and killed my own grandfather oh wait i never had one
TG: thank god we did that otherwise wed be screwed
TG: the arrangement being the coin flip thing
TG: im not going to stand by and watch you fall prey to your own wild cherry apeshit apocalypse
TG: ok stop that shit is probably like crack to you
TG: did i miss something
TG: and now here you are showing me
TG: and i did for like a whole day
TG: so i was like ok i can wait
TG: you said it came up bad heads
TG: bad heads to mean youd show me later
TG: i picked good heads to mean youd show me now
TG: not seein it
TG: so like i said before i had no choice at all i picked some options and you flipped a coin
TG: right exactly
TG: i guess
TG: punishing
TG: we were talking about a serious issue and im standing over my soon to be corpse while holding a fucking sword
TG: lets not get derailed here
TG: oh ok its someone who asks a bunch of dumb riddles i figured it out already
TG: what does being a seer of mind actually mean
TG: i dont know
TG: shouldnt you know better than me
TG: am i wrong in guessing that
TG: the loopholes are only temporary like look how davesprite turned out
TG: doomed means doomed doesnt it
TG: but i kind of doubt thats how it works i mean
TG: anyway maybe
TG: its just the worst thing when you get morbid
TG: whats the fucking point of giving a doomed version of myself superpowers anyway
TG: i thought you were bringing me back here to finish a stable time loop not murder a guy you punked whos gonna die regardless
TG: this is kind of useless isnt it
TG: then
TG: i was only bugging you about it cause you were being so vague
TG: then cool i guess i can live without wearing a sweet windsock hoodie and making time tornadoes or whatever
TG: ok
TG: like the right way
TG: do i ever make the god tier
TG: and please just drop your fucking justice riddles and be honest
TG: just one question
TG: i dont know
TG: well played??????
TG: i guess
TG: so
TG: and its just a big game you set up to watch me squirm over weird mortality issues while you giggle
TG: i think you got my whole timeline there in front of you and you know damn well i have no intention of killing this guy ever
TG: and not even the funny kind that qualify as distactions
TG: this whole thing was a ruse
TG: i think
TG: ok yeah youre right i just got won back over totally
TG: like ok you said something fucked up but hey theres a cute face my heart just fucking melted
TG: even when you bracket smile after it
TG: its not anywhere near as endearing as you probably think
TG: this is the morbid shit i was talking about
TG: this shit youre doing now
TG: see
TG: i dunno none of this is making for a very persuasive argument that i should kill doomed me
TG: what
TG: yeah
TG: it turned into schrodingers fucking dave
TG: and then
TG: schrodingers fucking coin
TG: it was like
TG: you didnt even look
TG: yeah because
TG: like
TG: what else do you know
TG: some kind of knowitall arent you
TG: you are just
TG: man
TG: yeah no fuck
TG: is that what you were doing just now
TG: oh do you
TG: means my skull is a bucket and my brains a plump fuckgrub
TG: i know it biblically its an obscene nsfw spectacle
TG: really well
TG: oh ok
TG: i mean that is the answer right
TG: fuck it ill just say all of it
TG: i dont know sounds like a riddle
TG: i obviously still dont know
TG: and
TG: yeah
TG: get what
TG: and had fuckall to do with your coin or randomness or luck
TG: the splitoff was a result of both possible decisions i could have made
TG: it sounds like
TG: was the trick really necessary
TG: i still dont really get what you did
TG: i dunno
TG: im not even actually mad i just
TG: i mean
TG: ok
TG: then i guess thats where ill go
TG: probably time we chill out for a while and i get back in sync with my teammates
TG: i sent you the money i got all the fraymotifs tell me what is there thats left besides you jerking me around
TG: is there anything else we need to do here
TG: so ok your coinflip of death was meaningless great to know
TG: this is bs
TG: you could smell a flea off a dogs balls
TG: thats fucking idiotic
TG: what you didnt
TG: i am forbidding you from ever flipping that coin again when youre talking to me or even thinking about me
TG: put your fucking death coin away jesus
TG: no fuck no
TG: i dont even want to be around when he wakes up itll be weird and awkward
TG: i guess thats enough of this horseshit time to move on right
TG: alright then
TG: now draw the conksuckiest boot you ever drew
TG: yeah
TG: ok im going to torrent you another like negative billion artifact grists
TG: yes perfect
TG: yeah see what i mean
TG: you just know imigrants were responsible
TG: its the conksuckiest piece of fucking shit that ever still somehow qualified as a boot
TG: whats up
TG: terezi
TG: hello
TG: now what
TG: well that was apparently pointless
TG: im here
TG: and if later you want to talk about it
TG: whats next is up to you
TG: so ill just say
TG: while knowing damn well you will anyway
TG: i wont do the bullshit troll thing and tell you what youre going to do and then just dare you not to
TG: and im not going to tell you not to
TG: youre about to do what youre about to do
TG: well
TG: kinda
TG: to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission
TG: which hopefully buys us some time
TG: all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back
TG: if we cant beat him
TG: suffice to say
TG: yeah well
TG: since you sort of lead the way in making that plan
TG: guess i shouldnt really say
TG: only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch
TG: and he stands no chance either
TG: johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment
TG: im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance
TG: look what he did to bro and davesprite together
TG: besides we cant beat him
TG: til then youre on your own for a while
TG: once its time to put the end game in motion
TG: then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think
TG: im getting pretty sick of it but i think itll be over soon
TG: there are loops outstanding and if i step out of line you get to see more bloody daves
TG: but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet
TG: well id like to
TG: you think
TG: what
TG: couldnt really bring myself to try to pull it out it was too weird
TG: but i couldnt
TG: when i was there
TG: i thought about taking his sword
TG: but thanks
TG: like if honor among thieves is something then lets call it camaraderie among ironic rapping roof ninjas
TG: if thats a thing
TG: but i guess it all sorta amounted to some vague unspoken semblance of kinship
TG: always being on guard for stealth attacks in the middle of the night while getting up to go to the fucking bathroom
TG: fightin off wave after wave of face pumicing puppet ass every day
TG: meh it was a pretty bizarre relationship by any standard
TG: i guess
TG: just imagine something ugly made by a jackass
TG: fuck it never mind
TG: where the fuck did that thing go
TG: makes the shipping chart pretty simple here hang on while i dig up that piece of shit karkat made
TG: bottom line is were all related slimewise except you and me and him and rose pairways respectively
TG: i thought john filled you in on the ectobiology stuff
TG: yeah roses too
TG: even crazy hard dudes like my bro slash weird covert biological ghost dad
TG: this is some pretty serious existence threatening shit going down and some people are going to die i guess
TG: not much to talk about
TG: yeah jack killed him too
TG: my bro
TG: what
TG: hes pretty much the guy in charge of random teleportation murders right now
TG: yeah
TG: nice
TG: yes you are go ahead and be relieved
TG: ill be fine
TG: i was swindled into splitting time paths along the way and that guy got the dead end of the stick
TG: but dont worry it was just a doomed dave no big deal really
TG: sorry you had to see that
TG: it wasnt a future dave he was from a while ago
TG: this is a dave out there whats up
TG: you people think im made of the stuff
TG: or wait maybe it was just a waste of time
TG: ok so 2=6 awesome joke hahahaha
TG: cool story
TG: makes no sense bye
TG: only trolls say theyre six i dont know whats up with you and that dumb fake age
TG: oh holy shit ok youre a troll
TG: asl???
TG: also
TG: and what did you think was so great about it
TG: also what was your favorite thing i did you liked
TG: what asshole gave you my chumhandle
TG: youre a fan of one of my websites arent you
TG: christ
TG: hey

TG: thats cool
TG: looks like youre a fairy
TG: oh sup
TG: i wasnt wearing this actually
TG: wait
TG: i cant
TG: howd it get like that
TG: it was this one
TG: and i wasnt wearing this shirt
TG: i remember that
TG: john gave me these new ones for my bday
TG: these arent my shades anymore
TG: this wasnt the suit i was wearing
TG: shit
TG: then why am i not awake as my dream self
TG: if im dreaming
TG: but
TG: which is why im asleep now
TG: and then i went to sleep at some point
TG: thats right
TG: and i was playing sburb
TG: yeah
TG: it was a black one
TG: no wait
TG: i was wearing this suit
TG: and then
TG: i woke up
TG: oh yeah
TG: wait
TG: its just a stupid pointless dream
TG: so then
TG: did it work is this part of the process somehow
TG: or i guess show me why i wouldnt
TG: terezi said id reach god tier
TG: and i went to take a nap
TG: it was this ugly fucking rag
TG: welp
TG: its the afterlife
TG: then this isnt a memory or a dream at all
TG: im dead
TG: so then
TG: what do i do
TG: i dont know like anything to keep helping my friends
TG: or stop it from happening or
TG: shouldnt i be able to do something about it
TG: if im seeing this
TG: but like
TG: why are you even here like why are you showing me this
TG: still doesnt seem right though
TG: just being one
TG: im up to my neck in dave already
TG: i think
TG: uh
TG: what about the other dead daves
TG: im just one dead dave offered up to the time god
TG: so
TG: was i
TG: would she do that
TG: i dunno
TG: terezi i guess
TG: probably
TG: who
TG: am i talking to someone there
TG: ok
TG: maybe
TG: sorta
TG: yeah
TG: i dunno
TG: i am him
TG: alpha me
TG: whats he doing
TG: aside from getting my ass killed in the most retarded way possible
TG: what did i do wrong
TG: dammit
TG: well
TG: is reality still a thing that means something can that be a question on the table too
TG: also
TG: like thats a thing that really happened
TG: like in reality
TG: bro dead there
TG: is
TG: but i guess i kept giving her shit about it and i knew she was kind of crazy and morbid anyways so whatever
TG: it would have been cool to know if picking one option would definitely kill me pointlessly so yeah
TG: so then i guess terezi tricked me
TG: lucky bastard
TG: fuck
TG: i dont remember this
TG: is this some disturbing ghost hallucination should i start slapping myself or what
TG: what is going on over here then
TG: ok
TG: if thats ok and i guess also possible
TG: and i guess chill for a while cause i guess it was all a bit much
TG: not that that doesnt sound cool but i kind of want to just go home
TG: how about later
TG: well
TG: yeah sure
TG: i bet you meant a laugh a whole lot less shitty than that
TG: haha
TG: ha
TG: it isnt
TG: what else
TG: just kidding that sounds cool
TG: boring
TG: where are the fucking hauntoffs at is what im asking
TG: like
TG: that ghosts get their shit worked up over
TG: the primary activity here
TG: what is like
TG: so what am i supposed to do now that im dead
TG: awesome
TG: can we not go to those parts
TG: hahaha
TG: a bunch of trolls flying around in little grub pods constantly screaming at each other through bullhorns shaped like buckets
TG: i pictured a lot more mayhem like
TG: i dont know its more subdued
TG: pretty cool not really what i pictured
TG: oh so this is the trollplanet
TG: where are we now
TG: youre not dead
TG: so
TG: are you dreaming
TG: you dont look dead
TG: what about you
TG: he looks dead
TG: so is he dead
TG: except not dying
TG: i guess i had it coming for a flagrant lifetime spent being unbelievably fucking incredible at rap and just about practically everything else
TG: its my eternal punishment to have shitty rapoffs with this tool forever is that it
TG: this is like a hellbubble right
TG: so aradia just so were clear
TG: gross
TG: dude
TG: ill break your brittle ass like a graham cracker and well roast smores over the flaming debris have i made myself clear
TG: i am your general fucking practitioner and doctors orders are to shut up and burn down my goddamn office
TG: you best not be bringin that fire into my bubble less you plan on dropping that shit
TG: are those sick fires youre packing there
TG: dude
TG: holy shit
TG: is this who i think this is
TG: aw hell no
TG: check it
TG: but horizontally means a clean break
TG: taking it vertically means drawing more blood
TG: if that swords coming out of his chest its coming out clean
TG: pretty much nothing but horsing around through time and swindling retarded alligators out of their life savings
TG: fine its a title we inherit as phlegm babies or whatever but what have i done to earn it
TG: no
TG: im not
TG: john is
TG: my bro was
TG: im not a hero
TG: im not john remember
TG: pulling swords out of things isnt how i roll
TG: forget it
TG: filthiest thing you ever said
TG: im just thinkin about how im gonna take this sword
TG: its pretty simple
TG: im sorry you are so flustered by the mere mention of glittering mythical cryptodick it honestly makes me think youre not ready for the truth
TG: they will be loosened only when presented with the conundrous grandeur of rigid insoluble puzzlecock
TG: tucked behind the pursed lips of a shitty riddler
TG: the truth is a mystery
TG: my rue is fucking bananas cant you tell
TG: behind these chill as fuck shades my face is having this crazy attack of the sads
TG: i am grieving to the max like a widow on dead husband island
TG: didnt say whether i actually would or actually am
TG: i said we agreed youd leave me alone to grieve
TG: exactly
TG: a guy can be sad and make jokes at the same time
TG: i was making a joke about being all broken up about it
TG: puppets arent cool theyre shitty small fake people who haunt your dreams and grin like permanent assholes
TG: no
TG: whoops ok in the future ill try not to pitch any sort of dramatics while brooding over the cadavers of slaughtered loved ones
TG: were just forfeiting all rhyme or reason to this unmitigated clusterfuck is that it
TG: so youre officially going nonlinear with me then
TG: it was five seconds ago
TG: you know like while i guess i grieved over this brutally murdered rad family member or something
TG: we just got done talking and agreed it would be awesome if you didnt bother me for a while
TG: what do you mean what
TG: oh my fucking god
TG: what things
TG: and its hard for me to disagree
TG: insisting someones gotta pay
TG: maybe i am supposed to be a hero and rise to the occasion because there seems to be this little persistent voice in my head nagging me about it
TG: i guess it has been on my mind
TG: yeah i guess
TG: jacks got shit to pay for
TG: when does someone actually step up
TG: im just wondering
TG: if anything id bet she just needs protection
TG: probably more a liability if she got it in her head to take him down
TG: i dont even know
TG: jade is
TG: too focused on machiavellian ploys of sabotage to try anything drastic
TG: rose spends all her time calculating
TG: johns too nice to get mad
TG: like always biding our time and tiptoeing around the unbeatable god boss
TG: working to take down the bad guy without a whole lot of this fuckin grandiloquence and these huge sweeping plans that got nothin to do with fighting him
TG: but ok i mean isnt that what heroes should be doing
TG: and that would be a bitchin line to switch the subject to start talkin about your complicated problems but i kinda wasnt done
TG: well ok
TG: what
TG: even among your group of irate gnashing shitheads
TG: and the only one even contemplating taking jack on
TG: no its not weird to be mad its just weird it feels like im the only one who is
TG: which is weird
TG: it might be kind of hard to tell on account of me chilling face down on the pavement and also because downplaying feelings is the chief rule of cool but im pretty pissed about this
TG: the god tier thing and whether i can actually do it or not
TG: but i mean ok we can talk about your troll problem but this is pretty important here
TG: thats practically unthinkable
TG: does something go wrong
TG: you mean god tiering
TG: before what happens
TG: for what
TG: i was getting sure you were just bullshitting me and had no intention of ever mentioning it again
TG: how long ago was it that you did your coin flip thing i dont even remember
TG: but yeah i guess its about time you showed me whats up with my allegedly futile god tierification
TG: ok
TG: why would i get mad at you
TG: the t in egbertian is soft like shhhhh
TG: almost egbertian in elegant stupidity
TG: that sure sounds like a dumb way to say a thing
TG: what
TG: bitten
TG: oh
TG: aside from the fact that several hours from now you apparently forget i dont need consolation and oughta be left alone
TG: why are you even talking to me anyway
TG: i dunno
TG: what
TG: go away
TG: fuck you
TG: no
TG: fuck that
TG: no
TG: i bet you are on goddamn pins and needles waiting for that arent you
TG: that was something that was mentioned at some point by someone i forget when or why
TG: you havent heard me bleat like a goat for ironically humorous purposes yet have you
TG: thats how all the best adventures get strung together
TG: thats what im doing here im making a point of makin every little thing take place what was once mentioned in passing no matter how seemingly trivial or pointless
TG: that is basically what i just did isnt it
TG: im a lie my ass right down here for a while looking slightly less cool than i make myself out to be ordinarily
TG: no fuck that
TG: why did i just say that stupid thing i said
TG: wait
TG: so completely illegal
TG: just like
TG: anyway you dont need a voice in your head to tell you this shit is
TG: ive never heard any voices or anything
TG: im pretty sure i dont even have an exile
TG: you call it the slammer when youre extra angry at crimes
TG: slammer means jail
TG: if i can figure out how to reach the god tier maybe i can be the one to throw him into the slammer
TG: cant let him just go unpunished
TG: someone has to make him pay
TG: right
TG: what were we talking about again
TG: ok that came out wrong
TG: no i mean
TG: shit
TG: what am i even saying here
TG: im just saying
TG: i know it doesnt
TG: no
TG: what
TG: fuck
TG: wait
TG: or some chalk or whatever
TG: are you taking notes on this important principle?? jesus get a fucking pen
TG: ok
TG: so
TG: anyway thats more shit that popped into my head just now
TG: holy shit why do i care about THAT suddenly
TG: but all the mutinous agents responsible for crimes
TG: not just going after jack
TG: and since no one else seems to give a shit about that it apparently falls in my jurisdiction now
TG: it is about justice though
TG: ok forget the slammer stuff that was stupid
TG: i have other duties to attend to
TG: its not like being mad about this and hankering for justice is even the only irrational thing im currently hot and bothered about
TG: anyway
TG: no
TG: not really
TG: thats what a real friend would do
TG: can you show me a little respect and assume any time i say something stupid it just means im temporarily being inexplicably retarded
TG: farewell is not even a thing i would ever say jesus what am i a victorian poet
TG: god damn it im not leaving
TG: no i mean
TG: farewell
TG: just please tell me your justice problem and make me stop saying stuff
TG: yes
TG: what justice thing do you have to do
TG: why dont we talk about your thing now
TG: im sounding like an idiot and my head is starting to hurt
TG: i need to shut up now
TG: probably
TG: thats gotta be what im talking about
TG: yeah
TG: oh
TG: never mind
TG: ive got to explode this ridiculously illegal edifice oh my god what are these words im saying
TG: ok i cant even make little interrogative quips to grease the wheels of your monologue
TG: she
TG: no i got that theyre like your alien death lawyers who were sorta like bounty hunters in olden times pretty simple to decipher through context
TG: oh shit are you fucking serious
TG: justice problems
TG: that sounds awesome
TG: thank you
TG: hasnt she done enough terrible shit to warrant legislaceration
TG: like second guessing whether she deserves it
TG: are you feeling guilty
TG: you dont sound that psyched about it
TG: youve decided to take her down then
TG: spidertroll
TG: didnt you say youve killed people before
TG: of course the fuck not
TG: was that all an act
TG: like being all cutesy about executions and smelling cherry blood and such things contrived to get a guy feeling vaguely uncomfortable
TG: i thought you were insane kinds of apeshit over the macabre stuff
TG: i dont understand
TG: cause i seriously dont have a clue
TG: you asking me to reassure you about that
TG: are
TG: i thought trolls were all about gratuitous murderings
TG: you mean you cant beat her in a fight
TG: so why dont you go do it
TG: why not let her go get her shit ruined by jack and let justice happen that way
TG: then whats the big deal
TG: do you think she stands a chance against him
TG: we can keep obsessing over your fucked up kismesister if you want
TG: ok fine
TG: lame motion overruled the judge wants to see where this is going
TG: what
TG: are you saying that i wont make god tier or i wont be strong enough if i do
TG: hunt me down and lawyerviscerate me for my own good
TG: are you going to stop me too then
TG: there is no john vs dave thing though
TG: are you sure about that
TG: does luck actually matter
TG: if for no other reason than itd be boring as hell to rehash it
TG: ie you right now
TG: except like in an offhand way thatll seem retroactively logical to your future self
TG: and i make sure not to reference anything said here to keep it simple
TG: so i hang up now with future you and then start pestering present you about it is that how it works
TG: these time shenanigans completely blindsided us they practically never even happen
TG: speaking of which
TG: and ill do the same
TG: why dont you just do what you think you have to do
TG: maybe if you kill her at least we can finally stop obsessing over her
TG: alright well all ill say is
TG: or to be a better troll
TG: do you want me to tell you to be a better human
TG: so i dont know
TG: it feels pretty weird and inappropriate for me to be the one to tell you fuck yes go for it shes got this huge murder with her name on it anyways and its cruising right at her down comeuppance boulevard
TG: to a member of a murderous species whos gunshy on going off to justicemurder a murderhappy murderer whose done lots of murders
TG: id like to help you out but i dont know what advice i should be giving
TG: ok
TG: are you ready
TG: its a whopper
TG: heres one for you
TG: cool listen to this
TG: are you busy
TG: i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation
TG: its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno
TG: like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties
TG: it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on
TG: doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper
TG: i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking
TG: im talking about a dream i just had
TG: ok whatever
TG: there is
TG: why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers
TG: ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods
TG: no no
TG: what
TG: this huge fuckin whopper im about to just say
TG: it was about me dying repeatedly
TG: it was so much more relaxing and enjoyable
TG: i know
TG: yeah thats a given but i didnt even dream about puppets this time
TG: i just want your professional take on how many things in my dream symbolize dicks
TG: no look
TG: all gestating at least 8 gooey octuplets thrashing around in an undulating belly full of mind slime
TG: its grotesquely pregnant with meaning
TG: no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those
TG: does this mean im dead
TG: this happened months ago
TG: this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all
TG: ok somethings wrong
TG: what the fuck are you talking about
TG: it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds
TG: not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission
TG: no
TG: and thats it
TG: so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage
TG: it was bright as hell even through my shades
TG: but even though the sky was black i could see the sun
TG: didnt see anyone singing
TG: i looked up into the sky
TG: theres not even much more to it
TG: oh my fucking god will you put that away
TG: so then youre consulting astrology books now
TG: what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that
TG: what did you read
TG: it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness
TG: and then i started to notice something coming from the sky
TG: so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff
TG: ok
TG: forget it
TG: i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this
TG: i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know
TG: im not sure
TG: i mean
TG: no
TG: this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that
TG: uh
TG: about what
TG: please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved
TG: and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them
TG: or that my beats might not be ill enough
TG: you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs
TG: and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead
TG: like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche
TG: but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow
TG: and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again
TG: or go another way and get stabbed or whatever
TG: there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off
TG: i kept dying
TG: well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out
TG: im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches
TG: god this is so generically morbid
TG: i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows
TG: i dont know
TG: yeah right
TG: god dammit
TG: am i dead or asleep
TG: this is so sick you using the dream bubble bullshit to pick apart my psyche
TG: stop it
TG: yes those exact bitches
TG: to nobody in particular i guess
TG: now what bitches
TG: so im like
TG: guess i failed my quest then
TG: i guess not
TG: you know just some dude
TG: the dave of guy
TG: maybe id rather just be like
TG: well maybe i never wanted to be a knight of time
TG: you know how you turned out to be this incredibly shitty seer of light and basically failed at that in every way imaginable
TG: i was never that cool with this
TG: not have to wonder all the time if i was taking a wrong turn and dooming everybody
TG: break out of the loops
TG: that id stop time traveling soon
TG: i just mentioned the basics to her
TG: none of this is that big a deal
TG: im telling you if i said anything at all about it she probably doesnt even fire her gun once and all im doing is dragging her into a doomed timeline with me
TG: anyway
TG: nah those are kept in emergency reserve for yo mama jokes from the 90s
TG: yes ima authorize a GOD DAMN you may swipe it at the door to check yourself into the burn ward
TG: its some delirious biznasty alright
TG: in your case probably
TG: youre just assuming and throwing around psyche buzzwords like aspd complex disorder
TG: you were all pavement faced and babbling your throefester speak and flipping off the shit with your own crazy deathwish thing why do you think you know what was going through my head
TG: about what i was feeling or what happened on lofaf
TG: you dont know anything
TG: this conversation just got bumrushed by a mudslide of fucking awful
TG: oh no
TG: aspd
TG: wtf
TG: what does that even mean
TG: that kind of changes how the whole thing goes doesnt it
TG: then i die and youve got to make out with me
TG: hey were gonna hunt frogs til you shoot me through the jack
TG: what am i really supposed to say
TG: what
TG: its manboobs are jiggling a little
TG: its jogging i guess
TG: havent we had this conversation already
TG: i dont try to understand your light shit do i
TG: with all the time shit going on
TG: hard to explain
TG: without even getting the satisfaction of standing up to him
TG: yeah i saw my future self fighting him so obviously that had to happen or else id be dead anyway
TG: and because i was supposed to
TG: because i wanted to
TG: i did that
TG: sure
TG: no
TG: that i didnt go or that im not dead
TG: whats not quite
TG: is that what happened did i go and now im dead
TG: wasnt i going to go
TG: wait
TG: no
TG: we were talking about who should go
TG: dumb
TG: the bunnys a she
TG: whered he go anyway
TG: he gave us the bomb
TG: then the cage bunny came
TG: after getting shot
TG: i remember waking up here
TG: fly it into the sun
TG: so i could pilot it out there
TG: we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon
TG: oh yeah

TG: man what the fuck is going on
TG: or should have
TG: because i should
TG: well i am
TG: will you just tell me whats going on
TG: ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit
TG: because i made the map so i know how to get there better
TG: is that wrong
TG: i delivered the bomb and now i must be dead
TG: then i guess thats what happened
TG: i remember that now
TG: oh yeah
TG: because thats all i fucking do is break swords
TG: so im thinking obviously i have to break the sword somehow
TG: then out of nowhere this sword appears in the thing
TG: couldnt think of how to break it
TG: but the chain was huge
TG: like i just fucked up some priceless shit in the louvre
TG: and it just snaps off with this comical shattering noise
TG: but as im thinking of how to do it i put my hand on it
TG: remember when that happened
TG: cause of dreambubbles
TG: like i did again just there with my hand
TG: see like that
TG: yeah
TG: whoops
TG: it still cuts like its plowing through a shaft of boneless zombie meat
TG: damn
TG: like this
TG: then i took it and sliced the chain
TG: holding that ball of yarn
TG: but you were just standing there not saying anything
TG: like say bye or something
TG: or i was going to
TG: and i said something to you
TG: and take it to the sun
TG: and i was going to fly up
TG: the moon started drifting away
TG: so then
TG: god thats right
TG: oh
TG: and then
TG: what youre taking a little nap on the moon in the middle of nowhere
TG: then youre dreaming
TG: so youre not dead
TG: and now youre dead and im dream chilling with your smug ghost
TG: and you went out there and blew up the sun
TG: im actually lying here on derse asleep
TG: so thats it
TG: its cool you are so tickled by this i hope it brought you a lot of rad laughs on your way to go fucking explode
TG: this probably comes close but that doesnt make it not lame as hell
TG: you not knocking me out with a ball of fucking yarn is fucking what
TG: the bunny or the actress
TG: sealing me in the air lock so i can go home to liv tyler and have the most terrible babies with her

TG: god dammit
TG: knocking me out so you can steal the suicide mission
TG: come on
TG: how do i wake back up
TG: yeah but i dont know how to wake back up is the thing
TG: almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon
TG: there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive
TG: yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it
TG: what do you care youll be dead like the mission thieving poser you are
TG: the sport pile doesnt stop from getting taller
TG: and even though youre dead all these fat millionaires in helmets just leap on your corpse anyway and pile up and i mean WAY up
TG: for best pile squad
TG: its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something
TG: no come on
TG: the football prize
TG: but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything
TG: the greedy qb is you
TG: and the quarterback sniped the fieldgoal just before the nfl buzzer went off
TG: its me im the tight end
TG: it like the tight end was going long down the yard in sudden death
TG: such has been whats happened
TG: and yet
TG: see you didnt consider sports you never consider the sports
TG: is that the sort of ignominy you want
TG: you dont gank the rock and steal the big mans thunder on his raucus drive to the hole
TG: its a widely known fact that cherry picking posers get showered in nothin but boos
TG: that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement
TG: i just think you should know
TG: no one likes a basketball hog
TG: all im saying is
TG: sports
